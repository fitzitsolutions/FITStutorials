SyncThing can be installed as a plugin, but it is not the most efficient way to get things done.  Doing it this way will require configurations with nginx that are inefficient.  The better way to do it is to create a Jail in TrueNAS and assign an IP address using DHCP.  Then, simply install it via the command line interface for the Jail.

Create Jail
MAIN MENU → JAILS → add jail (you will have to choose a Pool for the Jail)
Name:  SyncThing[add last octet of Jail’s IP], or name whatever you want
Jail Type:  Default
Release:  Choose the latest (on next menu, select DHCP, then Submit)
Start Service, install syncthing
You can use CLI (>SHELL) in the Jail, or SSH into it
NOTE: if you use Jail CLI, you’ll need to install vim ($ pkg install vim)
If you SSH, use ‘iocage’ to get into the jail (not if using Jail CLI)
$ ssh root@TrueNAS-IP
$ iocage console [Jail name]
Update Packages
$ pkg update
Select yes when asked
Install syncthing
$ pkg install syncthing
Select yes when asked
NOTE: the syncthing user should be UID ‘983’ but take note of it
Add options to syncthing using sysrc
$ sysrc syncthing_enable=YES
$ sysrc sshd_enable=”YES”
NOTE:  you can confirm the settings on the bottom of the file /etc/rc.conf
Add root login to SSH
$ vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Change “#PermitRootLogin no” to “PermitRootLogin yes”
Change the root password on syncthing
$ passwd root
Change it to something good
$ exit (to exit the console and back into the TrueNAS SSH)
Exit the CLI and reboot the Jail via the TrueNAS GUI
NOTE:  you can also restart the service with SSH ($ iocage restart [Jail name]
Check the processes for syncthing and sshd
Console into the Jail, or SSH using your new root:pass credentials
$ top
Use SSH forward so that your browser can reach the SyncThing GUI
$ ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8384 root@SyncThing-IP
NOTE:  this forwards requests from your browser to the SSH connection
Visit the SyncThing GUI via your browser:  http://localhost:8000
Change settings in SyncThing upon first visit (errors are common on the GUI)
Change SyncThing settings (top-right of browser window)
GENERAL TAB:  Device Name to whatever you’d like (default is name Jail name)
GUI TAB: GUI Listen Address: 0.0.0.0:8384 (so that the ssh -L isn’t needed)
GUI AUTH USER:  Add a name and password to the server’s SyncThing
CLICK:  select “Use HTPS for GUI”
SAVE
NOTE:  settings are saved in /usr/local/etc/syncthing/config.xml
You are done with the SyncThing GUI for now
TrueNAS GUI → Stop Jail and create a Mount Point for the files
JAIL → drop down list for the Jail → STOP the Jail
TRUENASE: Create a user for SyncThing to have permissions to a Dataset
ACCOUNTS → USERS:  Create user
FULL NAME:  syncthing[last octet of jail IP]
USERNAME:  same as full name
EMAIL:  optional
PASSWORD:  something fairly strong
USER ID:  This will be the UID noted above during SyncThing install
NEW PRIMARY GROUP:  ensure this is checked
All other defaults are fine
SUBMIT
STORAGE → POOLS:  Change Dataset privileges (create Dataset if needed)
DATASET → THREE DOTS → edit permissions (do not use ACL)
USER:  syncthing[last octet of jail IP] (same as user created before)
GROUP:  syncthing[last octet of jail IP] (same as user created before)
Check “Apply User” and “Apply Group”, All other defaults are fine
SAVE
TrueNAS GUI → Add the Mount Point to the Jail
MAIN MENU → JAILS → drop down options for your SyncThing Jail
MOUNT POINT → ACTIONS → drop down, click Add
SOURCE:  The Dataset on TrueNAS
DESTINATION:  Click mnt (this populates the field), and add a folder name
SUBMIT
TrueNAS GUI → Restart Jail by using the dropdown next to your Jail name
You can check the Mount Point via the CLI (>SHELL)
You can test permissions by adding and removing files (/mnt/foldername)
SyncThing GUI → Add Folder in the SyncThing GUI
Navigate to https://[SyncThing IP]:8384 (may remove default folder share)
Click on “+Add Folder” button under title Folders
GENERAL TAB:  Folder Label:  add any name
GENERAL TAB:  Folder ID:  same name as Folder Label
GENERAL TAB:  Folder Path:  type /mnt, then watch it populate, and add name
FILE VERSIONING TAB:  change to ‘Simple File Versioning’ and change to 10
SAVE
NOTE:  this ensures all permissions are correct
WINDOWS → SYNCTHING INSTALL
Google: SyncThing download, use the x64 installer
WINDOWS → Add a sync folder to the system
Go to the server’s GUI, click on Actions → Show ID, then copy the text
Open up the newly installed application
Click on “+ Add Remote Device” on the bottom right of the application
GENERAL TAB:  Device ID:  paste the copied ID
GENERAL TAB:  Device Name:  can name it anything
SHARING TAB:  Select the folders that were created (add if not there)
NOTE:  if they are not present, use the application to add folders
ADVANCED TAB:  Address:  tcp://[SyncThing IP]:22000
SAVE
SyncThing Server GUI, approve the new connection from generated from Windows
Wait for a window to pop-up with “+Add Device / x Ignore”
Select “+Add Device”
GENERAL TAB:  Device Name:  name whatever you want
All other defaults are fine
SAVE
NOTE:  services restart each time there is a save
SyncThing Server GUI, approve new folders from Windows
Wait for a window to pop-up with “Add / x Ignore” (one per folder)
Select “Add”
GENERAL TAB:  change the folder path to /mnt, then add a folder name
NOTE:  the name should describe the windows folder sync
NOTE:  after /mnt, you need to click on the root folder, then add name
FILE VERSIONING TAB:  change to “Simple File Versioning” and change to 10
SAVE
Now wait for the syncronize… it may take a while depending on size
DONE

NOTE:  for additional security, when this process is complete, you can go back and disable the root login to SSH by reversing step 4.
Change “PermitRootLogin yes” to “PermitRootLogin no”
A Jail restart will be required
