INITIAL SETUP STEPS
- Firewall, NAT, SIP, Intrusion Detection, and Static IP
- STATIC IP: ADMIN —> SYSTEM ADMIN —> NETWORK SETTINGS (set IP and check gateway)
- DEFAULT NAME:  SETTINGS —> ADVANCED SETTINGS —> (on bottom) SYSTEM IDENTITY
- NAT:  SETTINGS —> ASTERISK SIP SETTINGS (determines which IP address packets are sent out as)
- NAT:  verify WAN, and add local networks if needed and CRM systems or VPN —> click ‘SUBMIT’
- NAT:  see tabs:  General SIP, Chan SIP, Chan PJSIP
- NAT:  (Complicated to change ports)
- NAT:  (Default ‘main’ SIP port of 5060 is assigned to PJSIP by default… want to change it)
- NAT:  (We want to change the CHAN_SIP to the ‘main’ SIP port of 5060)
- NAT:  CHAN SIP TAB —> (scroll to bottom) BIND PORT (default 5160) —> change to 5260
- NAT:  (changing that to 5260 will allow us to change it to 5060 after changing PJSIP to 5160)
- NAT:  CHAN PJSIP TAB —> PORT TO LISTEN ON —> change to 5160 (click submit and OK)
- NAT:  CHAN SIP TAB —> (scroll to bottom) BIND PORT (now shows 5260) —> change to 5060 (click submit and OK)

- NAT:  COMPLETE
- IDS:  ADMIN —> SYSTEM ADMIN —> INTRUSION DETECTION
- IDS:  (blocks out intruders through attempts blocks, and whitelists good networks)
- IDS:  (BAN TIME of 1800 - half hour, MAX RETRY of 8, FIND TIME of 600 - 10 mins)
- IDS:  (if a device tries to login 8 times within 10 minutes, block the device for a half hour)
- IDS:  BAN TIME —> 3600, MAX RETRY —> 3, FIND TIME —> 300, WHITELIST —> trusted networks
- IDS:  SUBMIT, then you are COMPLETE with IDS
- FIREWALL:  CONNECTIVITY —> FIREWALL
- FIREWALL:  INTERFACES TAB —> ETH0 (is set to trusted, but we want to change to scrutinize the traffic)
- FIREWALL:  NETWORKS TAB —> (we want to whitelist the trusted networks, and the initial wizard results shows here)
- FIREWALL:  (it was redundant to have the host, and the subnet whitelisted, so delete the host)
- FIREWALL:  (now add in the additional networks to be trusted, if any) add networks, drop down to TRUSTED
- FIREWALL:  (don’t forget about the VPN, set it to trusted)
- FIREWALL:  (can whitelist WANs, and SIP providers) use the description fields so that you know what to delete later!
- FIREWALL:  INTERFACES TAB —> (eth2 is listed as trusted, use dropdown to select) select ‘Internet Default Firewall’
- FIREWALL:  (this action closed the gates, except for the LANs and Subnets that we specifically white listed)

- FIREWALL:  SERVICES:  all services are enabled by default though the internet zone… can change things to be allowed from WAN
- FIREWALL:  COMPLETE

EXTENSIONS
- Considerations for phone deployments
    — the extension digits (recommend 3 to 5 digits)
    — they should not overlap with existing dial plans or feature codes
    — don’t use 1xxx because it doesn’t know if you’re dialing x1234, or 1-234-xxx-xxxx (bad)
    — the 1 will automatically implement a pause for the United States
    — for multiple locations, the scheme should use a pattern (21xx, 22xx, 23xx)
- NOTE:  there are three different ways to add extensions - Bulk, Manual, and QUICK
- BULK:  ADMIN —> BULK HANDLER —> IMPORT TAB (used with a CSV file that is pre setup)
- MANUAL:  APPLICATIONS —> EXTENSIONS —> ADD EXTENSION —> +ADD NEW CHAN SIP EXTENSION
- MANUAL:  Brings us to the extension details page
- MANUAL:  (it’s easier to just use the QUICK add, then go back to edit manually

(OPTIONAL) MANUALLY SETTING UP PHONES
- each phone will be different… find the manual, log into the phone, and add the settings

SOFTPHONES
- Install Zophos on the computer and add an extension

ATA’s
- Analog Telephony Adapter (ATA)
- these are the analog phones
- Foreign eXchange Station (FXS) - used for analog phones, fax machines (not recommended), and misc devices
- Foreign eXchange Office (FXO) - used for copper POTS lines
- Recommend the Cisco SPA112 - 2 port FXS ATA

UPDATES
- Two types of updates… system for the OS, and the FreePBX updates for the software

- SYSTEM:   $ sudo yum update -y (this is for system updates)
- MODULE:  $ fwconsole ma upgradeall (this is the command for upgrading modules)
- DASHBOARD:  click the APPLY CONFIG button

PBX TRUNKING (Informational for learning)
- NOTE:  Use the ClearlyIP Trunking Module to add your trunks!! (link is below)
- Three types of common trunking:  POTS, PRI, SIP
- POTS:  Plain Old Telephony System (POTS) - old school coper lines that you would have in your home
- POTS:  done via an analog gateway (like the Sangoma Vega.  Can also be done with a PCI card (FXO card) in the server
- POTS:  very expensive, and not very flexible.  Must pay for extras like Caller ID
- POTS:  can purchase a HUNT GROUP (rollover group) which will be multiple lines.  If one line is taken, it will roll over to the next
- POTS HUNT GROUP:  bad because you can’t make a caller ID see only one number based on the line that’s available
- POTS HUNT GROUP:  can set up a voice mail at the carrier for the final roll over… not recommended because it’s not on the PBX
- PRI:  Primary Rate Interface (PRI) is a T1/E1 with 23 voice channels plus 1 D-channel (data channel)
- PRI:  T1 is the older technology with 23 channels and doesn’t have Caller ID.  E1 is 31 voice, and 2 D.
- PRI:  Vega 200G - need a gateway to convert the signal.  There are PRI cards as well that can go into the server.
- PRI:  it’s usually a VoIP running SIP until it hits your building, and is then turned into an E1 line.  Around $400 (doesn’t count usage)
- SIP:  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the most common VoIP protocol.  Skinny Protocol for Cisco, IAX for multiple Astrisk systems are some others.
- SIP PROVIDERS:  There are several types of SIP providers:  Pay-as-you-go, MRC (like a home phone w/monthly fee), and Enterprise.
- SIP ENTERPRISE:  gives a dedicated circuit and has on site equipment.  Most expensive, but most reliable
- SIP PROVIDER:  CREDENTIAL AUTH:  gives credentials (user / pass), then registers outbound through the firewall (stateful connection)
- SIP PROVIDER:  sometimes the firewall can be problematic by breaking connections
- SIP PROVIDER:  IP BASED AUTHENTICATION:  no need for user / pass.  Sends outbound to provider IP address.  Incoming goes to WAN.
- SIP PROVIDER:  IP BASED AUTHENTICATION:  have to open ports 5060 UDP, and 10000-20000 UDP.  Need to LOCK DOWN the firewall
- SIP PROVIDER:  IP BASED AUTHENTICATION:  make sure the firewall rules only allow port connections from the Provider’s IP address
- SIP HANDOFF:  also known as SIP peering.  It doesn’t use general internet connection
- SIP HANDOFF:  for outbound, the PBX will be peering through on-site equipment that has a dedicated circuit, separate from internet circuit.

CLEARLYIP MODULE:
- NOTE: This is used to automatically create inbound and outbound routes… no need to perform manual installation
- WEBSITE WITH INSTRUCTIONS:  https://kb.clearlyip.com/trunking/FreePBX-PBXact-Automated-Setup-with-Module.html

OUTBOUND ROUTES (use the ClearlyIP Module instead of this)
- NOTE:  Use the link above for the ClearlyIP Module instead of the below instructions to manually add a trunk
- NOTE:  This was used to configuration with ClearlyIP:  https://kb.clearlyip.com/trunking/FreePBX-PBXact-Manual-Setup.html
- Crosstalk Solutions uses Vitelity SIP Trunking
- Documentation is usually lacking from the providers on how to set up SIP
- PRI:  CONNECTIVITY —> DAHDI CONFIG
- PRI:  the cards in the server should show up there
- PRI:  GLOBAL SETTINGS —> SAVE.  Then you’ll have to restart the services
- SIP:  User / Pass can be set up through sub accounts for multiple numbers and locations
- SIP:  CONNECTIVITY —> TRUNKS —> +ADD SIP (chan_sip) TRUNK
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  GENERAL:  Trunk Name:  name it something with INBOUND (clearlyip-inbound)
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  GENERAL:  Outbound Caller ID:  use the phone number on your account
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  GENERAL:  leave the rest at default
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  DIAL NUMBER MANIPULATION:  leave as default
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  SIP SETTINGS:  OUTGOING:  name the trunk (clearlyip-outbound), then copy/paste the peer details from the provider (replace values)
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  SIP SETTINGS:  INCOMING:  delete USER Context and Details, and type in a Register String
- NOTE:  REGISTER STRING:  <subname>:<password>@<peer_details>:<port_5060>
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  now click Submit, and Apply
- SIP:  CONNECTIVITY —> TRUNKS —> +ADD SIP (chan_sip) TRUNK
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  GENERAL:  Trunk Name:  name it something with OUTBOUND (clearlyip-outbound)
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  GENERAL:  Outbound Caller ID:  use the phone number on your account (can also set to whatever)
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  GENERAL:  Maximum Channels:  10 (can put whatever you’d like)
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  DIAL NUMBER MANIPULATION:  leave as default
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  SIP SETTINGS:  OUTGOING:  name it something with OUTBOUND (clearlyip-outbound)
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  SIP SETTINGS:  OUTGOING:  Peer Details:  copy/paste from provider
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  SIP SETTINGS:  INCOMING:  can delete everything out
- SIP:  ADD TRUNK:  SIP SETTINGS:  click Submit and Apply	
- NOTE:  We’ve created the TRUNK, but now we need to tell the system to use it
- REPORTS —> ASTERISK INFO —> REGISTRIES —> look at CHAN_SIP_REGISTRY (to check if the trunk is working)
- NOTE:  now we need to create our outbound root
- CONNECTIVITY —> OUTBOUND ROUTES  —> +ADD OUTBOUND ROUTE (you can have several routes, but this one will be simple)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  name the route with EMERGENCY (it’s important to make sure that this is correct)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  Route CID:  use your phone number as the caller ID
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  Route Type:  set as an Emergency Route
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  Trunk Sequence for Matched Routes:  select the ‘outbound’ route that you created
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  DIAL PATTERNS:  use the wizard, uncheck the 7 and 10 digit patterns, leave US EMERGENCY
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  DIAL PATTERNS:  click on Generate Routes
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  DIAL PATTERNS:  you can delete the 933 one (it is a test)
- NOTE:  Match Pattern (send it out and match it), Prefix (for digits you are stripping off of the dial stream), Prepend (add to a number)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  ADDITIONAL SETTINGS:  Call Recording click on FORCE
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  EMERGENCY:  click on Submit and Apply
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  BUTTON —> +ADD_OUTBOUND_ROUTE
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  name it DEFAULT, this will be used if the dial pattern doesn’t match anything else
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  CID will be the phone number
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  Trunk Sequence for Matched Route:  use the OUTBOUND route you created before
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  DIAL PATTERNS:  uncheck Emergency, and add the 11 Digit Patterns, and Long Distance —> click Generate
- NOTE:  For the patterns, the ’N’ is any number 1-9, and the ‘x’ is any number 0-9 (can’t start dialing a number with a zero, so it shows Nxxxxxx)
- NOTE:  it generates the 7, 10, and 11 digit dial patterns… NXXXXXX, NXXNXXXXXXX, 1NXXNXXXXXX (two of the last one)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  Prepend 7 digit dialing:  1702 (need to prepend with the 1 and area code if someone is dialing locally)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  Prepend 10 digit dialing:  1 (most providers will accept a 10 digit, but it’s better to just give them an 11 digit)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  Prepend the last 11 digit dialing:  add a ‘+’ (this isn’t needed, but will cover various situations, mostly because of redial)
- NOTE:  you can do the dial pattern wizzard another time now and create patterns for US INFORMATION (411, 511, etc…)
- NOTE:  you can use the prefix to kill any ‘976’ or paid calls… type 1976XXXXXXX in prefix, and put in 0 for the prepend
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  IMPORT/EXPORT PATTERNS:  use this to export to a .csv if you want
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  DEFAULT:  ADDITIONAL SETTINGS:  Call Recording can be set to YES
- NOTE:  commercial modules may add other options to the ADDITIONAL SETTINGS
- NOTE:  You can add an outbound route for international calls… the dot ‘.’ that it adds means any numbers after the initial (011.)
- OUTBOUND ROUTE:  now you can sort the priority of matching, and hit Apply

INBOUND ROUTES
- this is saying that someone dialed my phone number… but what do I do with it?
- CONNECTIVITY → INBOUND ROUTES → +ADD INCOMING ROUTE
- IR:  GENERAL:  Description, create a Default (catch-all) route
- IR:  GENERAL:  Alert Info, this is a good way to set up a custom ring… leave default for now
- IR:  GENERAL:  Set Destination (there are a ton of options) → Extensions → choose your extension
- IR:  PRIVACY:  PM will intercept a call that comes from malicious or unknown caller ID phone calls
- IR:  OTHER:  Call Recording, set to YES
- IR:  OTHER:  CID Lookup, leave at default, but may want to look into it later

TROUBLESHOOTING:
20201117:  There was an issue with the Sangoma Appliance 60 where it would not reach out to the internet.  Through the network settings, I made Opt1 a static IP of .50, and made Opt2 DHCP.  After that, I was unable to ping google or get updates online for the system.  I have since change Opt1 back to DHCP.  My suspicion is that the system isn’t picking up a DNS server, and there is no where to put it into the FreePBX system that I know of (right now).  UPDATE: once I changed the Opt1 back to DHCP, I was able to ping google.

20201118:  I was able to upgrade to FreePBX 15 (from 14) using the upgrade module.  Instructions are here.  After that upgrade, nothing worked.  After a ton of research, it turns out it was some sort of version control though a file.  The fix was found here.

pFsense configuration:

Perform the initial basic setup for pFsense.

Step 1 - Forwarding of Ports

Navigate to Firewall > NAT


Click Add (If nothing is mentioned, leave as default)

Interface > WAN
Address Family > IPv4
Protocol > TCP/UDP
Destination > WAN Address
Destination Port Range > From Port > SIP > To Port > SIP
Redirect Target IP > Single Host > (PBX IP Address)
Redirect Target Port > SIP
NAT Reflection > Use System Default
Filter Rule Association > Rule NAT

Click Save

This should automatically create an entry under > Firewall > Rules (no need to edit that)

Secondary Port > Click > Add with down arrow

Interface > WAN
Address Family > IPv4
Protocol > TCP/UDP
Destination > WAN Address
Destination Port Range > From Port > OTHER > Custom: 10000 To Port > OTHER > Custom: 20000
Redirect Target IP > Single Host > (PBX IP Address)
Redirect Target Port > OTHER > Custom: 10000
NAT Reflection > Use System Default
Filter Rule Association > Rule NAT

That is all you need to do for basic configuration, of course if you customize the FreePBX ports then, the above should match those customizations.
pFsense SSL configuration: Enabling HTTPS for pfsense with a Self Signed Certificate
https://alphaengineblog.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/enabling-https-for-your-pfsense-with-a-self-signed-certificate/
Step 1: Create a backup and backdoor in case something goes wrong we can recover.

Log into pfsense.

Navigate to Diagnostics > Backup & Restore.

Skip Packages = Unchecked

Skip RRD = Checked

Encryption = Checked

Password = (create your preferred password and store it somewhere secure)

Select the options and Download your configuration as XML.

We will now enable ssh. 

We enable ssh so if something goes wrong and we can no longer access our Web GUI, we can access the server through a UNIX terminal or from PuTTy on Windows. 

Navigate to System > Advanced and scroll down until you find Secure Shell.

Tick the box to enable SSH > and leave the SSH port on the Default setting of 22 or change as desired. You can log into your pfsense via SSH using your Administrator password. Optionally you can choose to create a Public Key. After we have finished with our SSL setup, you can choose to disable SSH again if you wish.



Step 2: Creating a New Certificate Authority and Certificate for SSL.

Navigate to System > Certificate Manager > CA’s and click on Add


Default settings are fine here. You should give it a descriptive name so you know what it’s for. Fill out the location details according to your information.

Creating a Sub (Intermediate) Certificate

Next we need to create an Intermediate Certificate Authority.

Go to System > Certificate Manager > CA’s and click on Add again.



Enter your settings as in the screenshot. Again be descriptive in the name so you know what it’s for. Fill out the location details according to your information.

Creating a New Certificate

Now click on the Certificates Tab at System > Certificate Manager. Click on +Add/Sign to add a new certificate. Fill out everything as in the screenshot. Make sure to put your pfsense FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) to your pfsense server. In the Descriptive Name and the Common Name fields.



Certificate Attributes – The Certificate should be a Server Certificate. Make sure you put the IP Address of your pfsense firewall in the Alternative Names field along with the FQDN.



Exporting the CA’s

Navigate back to System/CA’s . This is important. Click on Export on both CA’s



Step 3: Import into Firefox
Open Firefox and head to Preferences > Privacy and Security > View Certificates.



Click on the Import Button and navigate to your downloaded ROOT certificate. It will have a .crt extension. Be sure to check both checkboxes.



Step 4: Enable SSL for pfsense

Log back into your pfsense firewall > Navigate to System > Advanced > Admin Access. Make sure HTTPS is selected as your protocol, and change the SSL Certificate to the one you have created. Scroll down and click on Save. Now, once you restart your web browser you should see a Secure Connection to pfsense when accessing it next time.



If it’s working successfully the little lock in your browser navigation bar will turn green. Selecting it will open a small window that confirms your current connection is secure.
